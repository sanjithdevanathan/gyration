Hey observer! Welcome to my little realm in the time space continuum,with every passing moment and every word you read, the hourglass of life looms over you and you are inching closer to a state of rest. With that being said, this is an overview of my portfolio in the making.You can find my past projects here and I will continue to update it as I navigate this journey called life, from weathering storms to basking in the sunshine.Cheers!
